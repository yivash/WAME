# WAME optimizer for occupancy detection problem (Keras)
<p><b>WAME optimization for Neural Net</b></p> 
<p>Weight-wise Adaptive learning rates with Moving average Estimator (WAME) is optimization technique that explores sign and magnitude of recent gradients to speed up convergence. This technique for controlled training keeps track of moving average, so the algorithm takes in acount smoothed values which allows to be not sensitive to extremes [1].</p>
